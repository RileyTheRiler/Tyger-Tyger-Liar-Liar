It's cold. It burns like ice against your skin.\n\nThe Blackwood house isn't burning down. It's burning *up*. The smoke is falling back into the chimney.\n\nThere are people on the lawn. Their mouths are open but the sound has been cut.\n\nMiller is there. His hand on your shoulder is a vice. A clamp. He's holding you down.\n\n\"Circuits,\" Miller says. But his eyes are bleeding. \"Just... wiring.\"\n\nInside the house, something slams against the front door. From the inside.\n\nIt knocks three times. \n\nThen four.\n\nThen seven.\n\nMiller smiles. It's the wrong shape.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
