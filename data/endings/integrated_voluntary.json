    "text": "You stop fighting. You open the door in your mind that you've been leaning against for weeks. The light floods in, not blinding, but absolute. It washes away the cold, the fear, the pain. It washes away *you*. You are no longer a detective. You are no longer a person. You are a frequency, a note in a song that has been singing since the stars were born. It is peaceful here. It is perfect.",
