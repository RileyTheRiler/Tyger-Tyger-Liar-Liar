        "base": "The ferry engine is a low-frequency violence that vibrates in your teeth. You stand on the rusted deck, watching Kaltvik emerge from the gray fog like a developed photograph. The town is a cluster of dark roofs huddled against the base of a cliff that leans forward, patient and heavy, like it's waiting for a reason to fall.",
        "lens": {
            "believer": "The fog doesn't drift; it reaches. It coils around the church spire with a purpose that isn't meteorology. Kaltvik isn't just a town; it's a wound that refused to scar over.",
            "skeptic": "Economic collapse is the only thing truly visible here. The 'fog' is likely a micro-climate created by the thermal mass of the cliff trapped against the cold harbor—compounded by the old coal seam fires that have been smoldering underground since '94.",
            "haunted": "The cliff face matches the texture of the Psych Ward wall. Cold. Pitted. Unresponsive. You've been staring at this town for months in your sleep. Now the dream has stopped being a choice."
