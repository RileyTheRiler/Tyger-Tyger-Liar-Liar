        "base": "The ferry engine creates a headache that vibrates in your teeth. You stand on the rusted deck, watching Kaltvik emerge from the gray fog like a developed photograph. The town is small, clustered against the base of a cliff that looks like it's leaning forward, threatening to push the houses into the sea.",
        "lens": {
            "believer": "The fog isn't natural. It moves against the wind, coiling around the church spire like a serpent constricting its prey. Kaltvik feels less like a town and more like a secret kept by the earth itself.",
            "skeptic": "Economic depression is visible from a mile out. Rusted roofs, failed infrastructure, zero new construction. The 'fog' is likely trapped particulate matter from the old coal seams burning underground.",
            "haunted": "You've been here before. In a nightmare, or a memory, it doesn't matter. The cliff face looks exactly like the wall you stared at for three months in the ward. Gray. Unforgiving. Silent."
