# Event Timeline: The 67-Day Night

| Day | Time | Observed Event [FACT] | Believer Interpretation | Skeptic Interpretation | Haunted Interpretation |
|-----|------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1   | 18:00| The Ferry fails to arrive. The harbor lights flicker and die. Radio shows static only. | The barrier is up. We are sealed in with it now. The static is a signal, not noise. | Mechanical failure on the mainland grid. Ferry canceled due to weather. Standard outage. | Abandonment. They left us here. Just like they left you in the waiting room. |
| 2   | 09:00| Maintenance worker (Old Tom) reported missing. Tools found near the North Woods trailhead. | He didn't walk away. He was *taken*. The woods feel heavier today. | Probably drunk and sleeping it off in a shed. Or hypothermia. Occam's razor suggests human error. | The town is starting to eat people. You know the pattern. First one, then many. |
| 3   | 22:00| "The Green Pulse" - Intense aurora activity. Strange audible hum recorded on tape decks. | The sky is watching. The hum is a frequency that speaks to the blood. It's waking up. | Solar flare interference. High atmospheric ionization causing auditory hallucinations (electrophonic hearing). | It looks like the fire. The sky is burning just like the roof did. The sound is screaming. |
| 4   | 14:00| Dead birds found arranged in concentric circles around the Town Square statue. | Geometry. They are marking the safe zones. Or the target zones. | Avian flu causing disorientation. They fell, and the wind/scavengers moved them. Coincidence. | They died trying to fly away. Just like you wanted to. |
| 5   | 03:00| The "Scream" heard from the Lighthouse. Glass shatters in 12 homes simultaneously. | Not a scream. A command. The glass bowed inward before breaking. | Rapid barometric pressure drop. Sonic boom from a testing jet? | She's angry. You broke the promise. |
| 6   | --:--| Fog density increases to visibility < 2m. GPS devices stop working. | The world is shrinking. We are being digested. | Satellite signal scattering due to atmospheric conditions. Just thick weather. | Blindness. Just like the medication made you. |
| 7   | 11:58| The Sun fails to rise. Official start of the Polar Night (3 days early). | It's gone forever. The lid is on the jar. | Almanac error? No, heavy cloud cover mimicking night. It's still there. | Darkness. Finally. Now you don't have to hide. |
