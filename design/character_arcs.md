# Character Arcs: The 67-Day Night

This document tracks the psychological progression of key characters across the game's timeline.

## Rules of Arc
1. **No Static Characters**: Every major NPC must have a "breaking point" where their behavior shifts.
2. **Ambiguity**: Arcs should have multiple interpretations (Observed vs. Lens).
3. **Player Impact**: The player's interaction (Trust/Fear) must influence the arc's resolution.

## 1. Vance (The Player)
**Throughline**: From detached investigator to integrated participant.
**Theme**: "To understand the cold, you must let it in."

| Beat | Narrative Stage | Psychological State | Observable Symptom |
|------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Inciting** | Arrival | **Detachment**. Viewing Kaltvik as a puzzle box. Clinical distance. | Taking notes, using tools, frequent "Skeptic" monologue. |
| **Escalation** | The First Death (Old Tom) | **Friction**. The tools stop working. Rational explanations require cognitive dissonance. | Hallucinations begin (The Hum). Sleep becomes difficult. |
| **Midpoint** | Radio Tower | **Complicity**. Vance realizes they are part of the history they are investigating. | "Haunted" lens becomes dominant. Losing time/memory gaps. |
| **Crisis** | The Week 16 Event | **Fracture**. The lenses diverge completely. Reality is a choice. | Physical symptoms (shaking, frostbite phantom pains). |
| **Resolution** | Endgame | **Synthesis or Collapse**. Acceptance of one truth (Believer/Skeptic/Haunted) or total breakdown. | Final ending state. |
