## 2024-05-23 - Hardcoded Flask Secret Key
**Vulnerability:** Found a hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` ('tyger_tyger_secret') in `web/server.py`.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secrets in source control are a persistent risk, even in local-first apps, as they can be blindly copied into production.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables or random generation for secrets. Added `secrets.token_hex(32)` as a secure fallback.
