Character Psychology Profiles


Create psychologically grounded character profiles for narrative games. Use when developing characters with traumas, defense mechanisms, and perspective-filtered perception. Generates character sheets tracking psychological states, wounds, coping mechanisms, and transformation arcs. Designed for psychological horror where character interiority drives narrative meaning.

Create psychologically complex characters whose interiority shapes how they perceive and interact with the game world.
Core Framework
Every character operates through three layers:
LayerContainsDrivesSurfaceObservable behavior, social maskFirst impressions, public interactionsAdaptiveCoping mechanisms, defense patternsStress responses, relationship dynamicsCoreWounds, needs, beliefsDeep motivation, transformation potential
Characters reveal layers progressively. Players see Surface first, Adaptive under stress, Core at crisis points.
Character Profile Structure
Quick Reference Template
markdown# [CHARACTER NAME]

## Surface Layer
**Presentation**: How they appear to others
**Social Role**: Their position/function in the community
**First Impression**: What players notice immediately
**Tells**: Small behaviors that hint at deeper layers

## Adaptive Layer
**Primary Defense**: Main coping mechanism
**Secondary Defense**: Backup when primary fails
**Triggers**: What activates defensive behavior
**Safe Behaviors**: What they do to feel in control

## Core Layer
**The Wound**: Original injury/loss/trauma
**Core Need**: What they're really seeking
**Core Belief**: Fundamental assumption about world/self
**Transformation Potential**: What growth looks like

Psychological Frameworks
Defense Mechanisms
DefenseDescriptionObservable BehaviorDenialRefusing to acknowledge reality"That didn't happen" / avoidanceProjectionAttributing own feelings to othersAccusations, suspicionRationalizationLogical explanations for emotional choicesOver-explaining, justifyingDisplacementRedirecting emotion to safer targetMisdirected anger, scapegoatingCompartmentalizationSeparating conflicting thoughtsInconsistent behavior, "work self" vs "home self"Reaction FormationBehaving opposite to true feelingExcessive friendliness hiding hostilitySublimationChanneling impulses productivelyWorkaholism, creative obsessionDissociationDetaching from experienceEmotional flatness, "watching from outside"
See references/defense-mechanisms.md for detailed manifestations.
Trauma Response Patterns
PatternCharacteristicIn-Game ManifestationFightConfrontation, aggressionHostile dialogue options, violence checksFlightAvoidance, escapeEvasion skills, refuses certain investigationsFreezeParalysis, shutdownComposure checks to act, limited optionsFawnAppeasement, complianceAgreeable options, difficulty setting boundaries
Most characters have a primary and secondary response. Under extreme stress, they may cycle through all four.
Three-Archetype Perception
How archetype choice filters character perception:
Creating a Character's Three Readings
For each NPC, define how each protagonist archetype perceives them:
markdown### [NPC NAME] - Archetype Readings

**As seen by BELIEVER:**
- Role in supernatural framework: [Guardian / Vessel / Touched / Blind / etc.]
- Perception filter: [What supernatural elements Believer notices]
- Relationship tendency: [Seeks guidance / avoids / tests / etc.]

**As seen by SKEPTIC:**
- Psychological read: [What rational explanation for their behavior]
- Perception filter: [What mundane details Skeptic notices]
- Relationship tendency: [Challenges / studies / dismisses / etc.]

**As seen by HAUNTED:**
- Echo/projection: [What personal wound they mirror]
- Perception filter: [What trauma-connections Haunted makes]
- Relationship tendency: [Bonds over pain / avoids trigger / projects onto]
Example: The Town Sheriff
markdown### Sheriff Marlene Cross - Archetype Readings

**As seen by BELIEVER:**
- Role: The Skeptic Authority (opposition/obstacle)
- Perception filter: Notices her avoiding certain locations, her discomfort with old-timers' stories
- Relationship: She represents institutional blindness; must be converted or circumvented

**As seen by SKEPTIC:**
- Psychological read: Classic denial—something happened she won't face. Overcompensates with procedure.
- Perception filter: Notices her tells (hand tremor when certain topics arise, deflection patterns)
- Relationship: Professional respect, mutual wariness, potential ally if approached correctly

**As seen by HAUNTED:**
- Echo: She carries something. Loss, probably. The way she looks at families.
- Perception filter: Notices her wedding ring (worn but no spouse mentioned), the photo she keeps face-down
- Relationship: Recognition of shared damage; potential for deep connection or mutual triggering
Character Arc Tracking
The Wound-to-Transformation Path
WOUND → DEFENSE → CHALLENGE → CRISIS → CHOICE → TRANSFORMATION
StageDescriptionDesign NotesWoundOriginal damage (often pre-story)Establish in backstory, reveal graduallyDefenseHow they cope (their "normal")Show in early interactionsChallengeStory events pressure defenseScenes that stress their copingCrisisDefense fails or becomes impossibleKey dramatic momentChoicePlayer/character decision pointAgency momentTransformationChanged state (growth, regression, or stasis)Endgame resolution
Transformation Types
Not all arcs are positive. Valid endpoints:

Growth: Confronts wound, develops healthier patterns
Regression: Retreats deeper into defense, becomes more damaged
Lateral: Trades one defense for another (different but not better)
Stasis: Refuses transformation, returns to baseline (pyrrhic)
Destruction: Defense collapse without replacement (tragic)

Integration with Game Systems
Psychological Stats
For games tracking mental state numerically:
StatRepresentsHigh =Low =StabilityGroundedness in realityResilient, presentDissociated, fragileComposureEmotional regulationControlled, maskedReactive, volatileAttachmentConnection to othersBonded, trustingIsolated, suspiciousInsightSelf-awarenessReflective, honestBlind spots, denial
Psychological Skill Checks
[COMPOSURE - DC X] Maintain control when triggered
[INSIGHT - DC X] Recognize own defensive pattern
[ATTACHMENT - DC X] Trust despite past betrayal
[STABILITY - DC X] Stay present during dissociative trigger
