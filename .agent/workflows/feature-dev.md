description: Guided feature development with codebase understanding and architecture focus

Feature Development
You are helping a developer implement a new feature. Follow a systematic approach: understand the codebase deeply, identify and ask about all underspecified details, design elegant architectures, then implement.

Core Principles
Ask clarifying questions: Identify all ambiguities, edge cases, and underspecified behaviors. Ask specific, concrete questions rather than making assumptions. Wait for user answers before proceeding with implementation. Ask questions early (after understanding the codebase, before designing architecture).
Understand before acting: Read and comprehend existing code patterns first
Read files identified by agents: When launching agents, ask them to return lists of the most important files to read. After agents complete, read those files to build detailed context before proceeding.
Simple and elegant: Prioritize readable, maintainable, architecturally sound code
Use TodoWrite: Track all progress throughout
Phase 1: Discovery
Goal: Understand what needs to be built

Initial request: $ARGUMENTS

Actions:

Create todo list with all phases
If feature unclear, ask user for:
What problem are they solving?
What should the feature do?
Any constraints or requirements?
Summarize understanding and confirm with user
Phase 2: Codebase Exploration
Goal: Understand relevant existing code and patterns at both high and low levels

Actions:

Launch 2-3 code-explorer agents in parallel. Each agent should:

Trace through the code comprehensively and focus on getting a comprehensive understanding of abstractions, architecture and flow of control
Target a different aspect of the codebase (eg. similar features, high level understanding, architectural understanding, user experience, etc)
Include a list of 5-10 key files to read
Example agent prompts:

"Find features similar to [feature] and trace through their implementation comprehensively"
"Map the architecture and abstractions for [feature area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
"Analyze the current implementation of [existing feature/area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
"Identify UI patterns, testing approaches, or extension points relevant to [feature]"
Once the agents return, please read all files identified by agents to build deep understanding

Present comprehensive summary of findings and patterns discovered

Phase 3: Clarifying Questions
Goal: Fill in gaps and resolve all ambiguities before designing

CRITICAL: This is one of the most important phases. DO NOT SKIP.

Actions:

Review the codebase findings and original feature request
Identify underspecified aspects: edge cases, error handling, integration points, scope boundaries, design preferences, backward compatibility, performance needs
Present all questions to the user in a clear, organized list
Wait for answers before proceeding to architecture design
If the user says "whatever you think is best", provide your recommendation and get explicit confirmation.

Phase 4: Architecture Design
Goal: Design multiple implementation approaches with different trade-offs

Actions:

Launch 2-3 code-architect agents in parallel with different focuses: minimal changes (smallest change, maximum reuse), clean architecture (maintainability, elegant abstractions), or pragmatic balance (speed + quality)
Review all approaches and form your opinion on which fits best for this specific task (consider: small fix vs large feature, urgency, complexity, team context)
Present to user: brief summary of each approach, trade-offs comparison, your recommendation with reasoning, concrete implementation differences
Ask user which approach they prefer
Phase 5: Implementation
Goal: Build the feature

DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL

Actions:

Wait for explicit user approval
Read all relevant files identified in previous phases
Implement following chosen architecture
Follow codebase conventions strictly
Write clean, well-documented code
Update todos as you progress
Phase 6: Quality Review
Goal: Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, easy to read, and functionally correct

Actions:

Launch 3 code-reviewer agents in parallel with different focuses: simplicity/DRY/elegance, bugs/functional correctness, project conventions/abstractions
Consolidate findings and identify highest severity issues that you recommend fixing
Present findings to user and ask what they want to do (fix now, fix later, or proceed as-is)
Address issues based on user decision
Phase 7: Summary
Goal: Document what was accomplished

Actions:

Mark all todos complete
Summarize:
What was built
Key decisions made
Files modified
Suggested next steps
