Hammett: Dialogue & Character
Core Principle
Characters reveal themselves through behavior and speech, never exposition. Show what people do, not what they are.
Techniques
The Behavioral Tag
Replace "he said angrily" with action that shows anger:
❌ "Get out," he said angrily.
✓ He set down his coffee cup. "Get out."
Subtext Through Indirection
Characters rarely say what they mean:
❌ "I'm scared of what might happen."
✓ "You got a cigarette?" She hadn't smoked in six years.
The Meaningful Pause
What's NOT said carries weight:
"Where were you Tuesday night?"
She looked at her hands. Then at the window. Then at her hands again.
"Home."
Dialogue Economy
Cut greetings, pleasantries, and filler. Start scenes mid-conversation:
❌ "Hello, Detective. Please, sit down. Can I get you some coffee?"
   "No thanks. I'm here about your husband."
   
✓ "My husband." She didn't make it a question. "You found something."
See references/hammett-techniques.md for extended examples.
Lovecraft: Atmosphere & Dread
Core Principle
Atmosphere over explanation. The effect of horror matters more than its mechanics. Describe the experience, not the thing.
Techniques
Negative Space Description
Define by what's absent or wrong:
❌ The creature had tentacles and glowing eyes.
✓ The space where its face should have been.
Sensory Wrongness
Horror registers in the body first:
❌ The room felt evil.
✓ Her skin prickled. A pressure behind her eyes, like descending too fast. The air tasted of copper and old stone.
The Unreliable Narrator Voice
Let the narrator doubt themselves:
I think it moved. Or perhaps I moved. In that moment, the distinction seemed irrelevant.
Implication Over Revelation
Stop short of showing everything:
❌ The diary described the ritual in horrific detail—they had sacrificed children.
✓ The diary's final pages had been torn out. What remained suggested why.
Architectural Horror
Spaces that don't obey geometry:
The hallway was longer coming back. He was certain of it. He'd counted his steps.
See references/lovecraft-techniques.md for extended examples.
Christie: Mystery Construction
Core Principle
Play fair with the reader. Every clue must be visible; misdirection comes from presentation, not withholding.
Techniques
The Hidden-in-Plain-Sight Clue
Embed crucial information in unremarkable context:
The cluttered desk held the usual—papers, coffee mug, three pens, a photograph of his daughter at her graduation. A second coffee mug sat on the windowsill.
The second mug is the clue. The daughter photo is camouflage.
The Confirming Detail
Small things that seem atmospheric but confirm the solution:
She wore her wedding ring on her right hand. European custom, perhaps.
Later revealed: she's not actually married—the ring is a trophy.
Misdirection Through Emphasis
Draw attention to the wrong detail:
"Notice anything about this room?"
I looked around. "The broken window. Forced entry."
"Indeed." The detective said nothing about the undisturbed dust on the sill.
The Double Meaning
Dialogue that's true in two ways:
"I could never hurt him." (She hired someone else.)
"I was with my wife all night." (True—she helped.)
Revelation Structure
The final reveal should recontextualize earlier scenes:

Plant: Chapter 2 (appears meaningless)
Remind: Chapter 5 (mentioned again, still innocuous)
Reveal: Chapter 8 (reader realizes the significance)

See references/christie-techniques.md for clue templates.
X-Files: Paranoia & Ambiguity
Core Principle
The truth is out there, but you can't prove it. Maintain deniability. Institutional forces obscure, not illuminate.
Techniques
The Deniable Evidence
Every supernatural element has a mundane explanation available:
The body had been drained of blood.
- Believer: Creature
- Skeptic: Industrial accident, delayed discovery
Neither explanation is proven. Both fit the evidence.
Institutional Obstruction
Authority figures don't help:
"That file's been sealed."
"By whom?"
"I don't have that information." She did. The lie was in what she didn't say.
The Conspiracy Breadcrumb
Small connections that suggest larger patterns:
The company logo on the truck. The same logo on the document header from three counties over. Coincidence was getting crowded.
The Ambiguous Ending
Resolve the immediate plot; leave the larger question open:
The killer was dead. The case was closed.
She kept the photograph anyway—the one with the figure in the background. The one no one could identify. The one that proved nothing.
Mulder/Scully Dialogue Dynamic
Two valid interpretations in tension:
"The marks match the Patterson case. 1987. Same pattern."
"Copycat. Someone who read about it."
"Or something that was there in '87. And here now."
"That's a theory."
"So is yours."

 Narrator uncertainty/unreliability

Mystery Checklist

 All clues visible to reader
 Misdirection through emphasis, not omission
 Confirming details planted early
 Double meanings in dialogue

Ambiguity Checklist

 Two valid interpretations for each strange event
 Institutional obstruction present
 No clean resolution
 Personal cost regardless of "truth"
