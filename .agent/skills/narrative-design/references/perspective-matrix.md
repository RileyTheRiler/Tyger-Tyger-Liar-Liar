## Emotional Tone Filters

### Fear Response

- **BELIEVER**: Awe mixed with terror. The sublime horror of the genuine unknown.
- **SKEPTIC**: Frustration with uncertainty. Fear of losing rational control.
- **HAUNTED**: Recognition. This has happened before, is happening again.

### Discovery Response

- **BELIEVER**: Validation. Proof of a larger reality.
- **SKEPTIC**: Puzzle piece. Data requiring explanation.
- **HAUNTED**: Trigger. Connection to personal trauma.

### NPC Interaction Tone

- **BELIEVER**: Seeks confirmation, builds alliances with other believers.
- **SKEPTIC**: Gathers testimony, looks for inconsistencies and motives.
- **HAUNTED**: Sees ghosts of their own past in every face.

## Narrative Voice Guidelines

### Internal Monologue Style

**BELIEVER** (sense of wonder, pattern recognition):
> The symbol on the wall matches the one in grandmother's journal. They were here. They've always been here.

**SKEPTIC** (analytical, questioning):
> Three witnesses, three different descriptions. Classic confabulation. But the physical evidence doesn't fit any standard explanation.

**HAUNTED** (fragmented, trauma-inflected):
> The same smell. Pine and copper and cold. The cabin. The lake. No—focus. This is now. This is different. It has to be different.

### Dialogue Attribution

When filtering NPC dialogue through perspectives:

**BELIEVER** hears: Subtext of hidden knowledge, warnings, ancient awareness
**SKEPTIC** hears: Evasion, inconsistency, potential deception
**HAUNTED** hears: Echoes of past conversations, familiar cadences, triggers

## Ambiguity Preservation Rules

1. **Never confirm or deny** supernatural elements in THE EVENT layer
2. **Every perception must be defensible** within its archetype's framework
3. **Physical evidence supports all interpretations** or explicitly contradicts none
4. **NPCs believe their own version** — no character has objective truth
5. **Player choice determines narrative weight**, not objective reality
